## About

I study theoretical computer science, mathematics, and physics. I like understanding how things work from the ground up, whether that's a math proof, a binary exploit, or a physics problem. This is where I share what I learn.

## What I Work On

**Theory & Math:**
- Mathematical logic and proof theory
- Complexity theory
- Abstract algebra and category theory
- Differential geometry and topology
- Quantum mechanics and mathematical physics
- Type theory and formal verification

**Security & Systems:**
- Binary exploitation and reverse engineering
- Memory corruption bugs
- Control flow analysis
- Cryptography and protocol analysis
- Low-level system internals

## Blog Topics

I write detailed technical posts on:

- **Exploit Development:** memory bugs, ROP chains, heap tricks, kernel exploits
- **Reverse Engineering:** binary analysis, decompilation, obfuscation, malware analysis
- **Mathematics:** real analysis, algebra, discrete math, number theory, graph theory
- **Geometry:** computational, differential, and algebraic geometry
- **Physics:** quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, field theory
- **Theoretical CS:** automata, lambda calculus, complexity classes, formal languages

## How I Think

I start from the basics and build up. Whether it's a proof or an exploit:

1. Get the fundamentals right
2. Work from definitions and axioms
3. Connect theory to practice
4. Write down every step

If the reasoning is solid, the knowledge sticks.
