## 🔍 Exploring the Foundations of Computing

I am deeply interested in the **logical and mathematical principles** that shape computing. My work goes beyond writing code. I explore **how computation works at its core**, questioning its **foundations, limitations, and security**.

### 🏛 Core Areas of Interest
- **Formal Logic & Computability** – Understanding what can and cannot be computed.
- **Philosophy of Software** – Investigating the **ontological and epistemological** nature of programs.
- **Software Security & Code Analysis** – Strengthening systems by identifying **structural weaknesses**.

### 🌍 Multilingual Communication
I engage with diverse perspectives, speaking multiple languages:  
- **Turkish** 🇹🇷 (Native)  
- **English** 🇬🇧 (Fluent)  
- **Dutch** 🇳🇱 (Fluent)  
- **Russian** 🇷🇺 (Pre-Intermediate)  

### 🧠 Logic, Security & Theoretical Computing
I approach computing as a **logical system** built on rules, yet shaped by real-world constraints. By combining **theory and practice**, I aim to create **more robust, secure, and well-structured** software.

🚀 Always exploring **deeper questions** in computing, security, and formal logic.
