## Hey fellow Hackers! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub page. As a self-disciplined individual, I am working hard to improve myself to learn about reverse engineering and malware analysis. Not only with that, I am also fascinated by math theorems, number theory, geometry, and algebra. So this page will include more about those things. I do love working to improve algebra problems, conducting malware analysis in pieces, and understanding low-level programming. My favorite programming languages are assembly and C, so in this way, I have been enhancing to pursue becoming a master.
