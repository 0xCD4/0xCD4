Emphasizing the ideas of logic and philosophical mathematics, I am quite involved in investigating the theories and philosophy behind computing.  My work transcends coding; I want to grasp the ontological and epistemological bases of software development.  In addition to this theoretical quest, I focus on code analysis and software security hoping to strengthen systems against weaknesses.  Being multilingual and fluent in Turkish, English, Russian(pre-intermediate), and Dutch also helps me to interact and work well in a variety of settings.
