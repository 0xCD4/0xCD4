# 🧠 Computing Theory & Formal Systems

I am a computer science theorist working at the intersection of **logic**, **epistemology**, and **software systems**. My research investigates:

- What *can* and *cannot* be computed (formal logic, Turing machines, complexity classes)
- How programs *represent knowledge* and encode *assumptions* about reality
- How vulnerabilities arise from *structural failures* in software logic
- The ontological and epistemic meaning of *computation* itself

My approach is abstract, mathematical, and language-theoretic—focusing on deep structure rather than surface syntax.

## 🔬 Core Research Axes
- **Formal Logic & Computability**: Recursive functions, lambda calculus, undecidability
- **Epistemology of Software**: Programs as knowledge agents
- **Security as Logical Analysis**: Vulnerability as proof failure
- **Philosophy of Computing**: Computation as structured thought

## 🌍 Linguistic Systems
I view language as computation’s oldest abstraction layer:
- 🇹🇷 Turkish (native)
- 🇬🇧 English (fluent)
- 🇳🇱 Dutch (fluent)
- 🇷🇺 Russian (pre-intermediate)
